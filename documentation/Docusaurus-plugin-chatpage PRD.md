# Docusaurus-Plugin-ChatPage PRD

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 About Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a modern, React‑based s

tatic site generator designed specifically for documentation websites. Its core strengths include Markdown‑driven content, versioning, localization, customizable themes, and a flexible plugin ecosystem that allows developers to extend its functionality without reinventing the wheel.

### 1.2 Current Gaps and Opportunities

While Docusaurus excels at delivering static documentation, it currently lacks a native solution for interactive, context‑aware chat experiences that help users quickly find answers within the documentation. Specifically:

- Interactive Q&A: End‑users cannot ask questions in real time and receive answers drawn directly from the documentation content.
- Automated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): There’s no built‑in support for ingesting documentation, computing semantic embeddings, and then using these embeddings to retrieve relevant content in response to user queries.
- Plug‑and‑Play Experience: Documentation maintainers would prefer a solution that requires minimal configuration (e.g., providing only an OpenAI API key) without needing to manage a backend database or additional API keys for vector storage.

This plugin aims to fill that gap by integrating an ingestion pipeline (run during Docusaurus build) with a client‑side chat interface that leverages pre‑computed document embeddings for RAG—delivering a seamless and interactive Q&A experience for documentation websites.

## 2. Plugin Objectives

The primary goals of the Docusaurus‑Plugin‑ChatPage are to:

- Build-Time Ingestion:

  - Automatically scrape and process documentation content (e.g., using LangChain’s RecursiveURLLoader/SitemapLoader and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter).
  - Compute vector embeddings (via OpenAI’s API) and bundle these results as static assets (JSON files) during the Docusaurus build.

- Client-Side Retrieval & Q&A:
- Load the pre‑computed embeddings on the client using a lightweight vector search library (e.g., client‑vector‑search or entity‑db).
- For each user query, use the chat history and the new input to generate a standalone question, compute its embedding (or use a lightweight model), and then retrieve the most relevant documentation chunks.
- Use the retrieved context alongside the query to generate a final answer via an LLM call (using the provided OpenAI API key), with support for streaming responses.
- Plug‑and‑Play Experience:
- Require minimal configuration for the end‑user—only the OpenAI API key should be necessary.
- Eliminate the need for users to manage their own databases or additional API keys by performing the heavy lifting (ingestion, embedding computation, vector storage) at build time.
- User Feedback and Traceability (Optional):
- Generate a session trace (or trace URL) that enables users to see the retrieval details and provide feedback, all within a lightweight setup.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

- Ingestion Pipeline:

  - Scraping documentation and GitHub code at build time.
  - Splitting documents into chunks and computing embeddings with an OpenAI API call.
  - Storing the resulting vectorstore as a static JSON asset bundled with the site.

- Client‑Side Chat Interface:
- A React‑based chat UI integrated into Docusaurus as a new route (e.g., /chat).
- Client‑side similarity search over the pre‑computed embeddings for retrieval‑augmented generation.
- Integration with OpenAI for generating answers, with support for conversational context and response streaming.
- Configuration:
- Minimal configuration through docusaurus.config.js (e.g., only an OpenAI API key and optional customization settings).

### Out of Scope

- Live or Persistent Databases:

  - No need for managing external vector databases (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate Cloud) or backend servers to persist data.

- Real‑Time Collaborative Features:
- The plugin will focus solely on enabling interactive Q&A on static documentation sites, not on providing real‑time collaborative editing or content corrections.
- Re‑implementation of Core Docusaurus Features:
- The plugin does not re‑implement Docusaurus’s built‑in content management, versioning, or localization features.

## 4. Target Users & User Stories

### 4.1 Target Users

- Documentation Maintainers:
  Technical writers, developers, and documentation managers who need to provide an interactive support experience without the overhead of maintaining additional infrastructure.
- End‑Users of Documentation:
  Developers, engineers, and other technical audiences who use the documentation and would benefit from an interactive, conversational Q&A interface that helps them find information quickly.

### 4.2 User Stories

- US1: Seamless Q&A Experience
  As a documentation user, I want to ask questions about the content of the documentation and receive context‑specific answers, so that I can quickly find the information I need without manually searching through pages.
- US2: Minimal Configuration
  As a documentation maintainer, I want to integrate an interactive chat page into my Docusaurus site by simply providing an OpenAI API key, so I don’t have to manage additional databases or backend services.
- US3: Build-Time Efficiency
  As a documentation maintainer, I want the ingestion pipeline (scraping, splitting, embedding) to run during the Docusaurus build process so that all heavy processing is done ahead of time, ensuring a fast, client‑side interactive experience.
- US4: Actionable Trace and Feedback
  As a user, I want to see the source or context behind the provided answers (e.g., a trace URL or snippet preview) so that I can verify the accuracy of the response and provide feedback if necessary.

## 5. Roadmap & Milestones

### Phase 1: Planning & Design

- Finalize requirements and define the architecture.
- Create UI/UX mockups for the chat interface and (optional) admin/feedback dashboard.
- Define the build-time ingestion workflow and necessary API contracts.

### Phase 2: Ingestion Pipeline Development

- Implement content fetching (via RecursiveURLLoader/SitemapLoader) and text splitting.
- Integrate OpenAI embedding computation and output the vectorstore as a JSON file.
- Ensure the ingestion pipeline integrates with the Docusaurus build lifecycle (using loadContent/contentLoaded).

### Phase 3: Client‑Side Chat Interface

- Develop a responsive React component for the chat page.
- Integrate a client‑side vector search library to load and query the pre‑computed vectorstore.
- Implement chat logic to combine conversation history with the new query, retrieve context, and generate answers via the OpenAI API.

### Phase 4: Testing & Iteration

- Unit test ingestion and chat modules.
- Integration testing to ensure the plugin correctly intercepts the Docusaurus build process and injects routes/data.
- User Acceptance Testing with beta users to collect feedback and iterate on features.
- Performance testing to verify that the build time overhead and runtime performance meet acceptable thresholds.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation

- Package and publish the plugin (e.g., on npm/yarn).
- Create comprehensive documentation, examples, and integration guides.
- Roll out the beta release and monitor user feedback.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria & Testing Requirements

- Ingestion Pipeline Accuracy:

  - All documentation pages are successfully scraped, split, and embedded during build time.
  - The generated vectorstore is correctly output as a JSON asset and is loadable by the client.

- Chat Interface Functionality:
- The chat page is accessible via a defined route (e.g., /chat).
- User queries are rephrased into standalone questions and processed correctly.
- Similarity search returns contextually relevant document snippets with at least 80% precision.
- The answer generation using the OpenAI API returns coherent and context‑specific responses.
- The conversation state is maintained, and any session trace/feedback is properly handled.
- Performance Metrics:
- Build time increase due to the ingestion pipeline is minimal (e.g., under a 10% increase).
- API response times (for OpenAI calls and client‑side vector search) remain within acceptable limits (e.g., < 2 seconds per query).
- User Experience:
- Documentation maintainers report that the integration is plug‑and‑play and requires minimal configuration.
- End‑users find the chat interface intuitive and useful for retrieving documentation information.
- Feedback from beta testing indicates an overall positive experience and actionable insights.
