## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1. About Docusaurus**

Docusaurus is a modern, React‑based static site generator tailored for building documentation websites. Its core features include:

* **Markdown‑Based Content:** Write documentation easily with Markdown and benefit from built‑in code highlighting.  
* **Versioning & Localization:** Manage multiple versions and support multiple languages.  
* **Customizable Themes:** Easily adapt the site's look and feel.  
* **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend functionality via a wide variety of official and community‑developed plugins.  
* **Static Site Generation:** Produce fast, SEO‑friendly sites deployable on any hosting platform.

### **1.2. What Docusaurus Lacks**

While Docusaurus offers a great foundation, it does not provide built‑in tools to automatically ensure content quality or to leverage semantic data for intelligent content organization. Documentation maintainers must manually check for:

* **Formatting Issues:** Inconsistent styling, header misalignments, etc.  
* **Broken Links:** Outdated or missing references.  
* **Missing Metadata:** Absence of page titles, descriptions, or tags.  
* **Semantic Interlinking:** Manual cross‑linking between related content.

## **2\. Plugin Objectives**

This plugin aims to bridge the gap by providing:

* **Major Content Quality Checks:** Automated detection of formatting errors, broken links, and missing metadata.  
* **AI‑Powered Semantic Analysis:** Evaluation of content quality, readability, and understandability through semantics. The plugin will:  
  * Suggest relevant backlinks between related pages.  
  * Group semantically similar pages to highlight redundancy and recommend potential merging.  
  * Offer additional insights like keyword extraction, concept identification, and suggestions for content reorganization.

### **Additional Ideas Based on Semantic Data:**

* **Redundancy & Overlap Analysis:** Detect and flag content that overlaps significantly, suggesting areas to consolidate.  
* **Automated Glossary Generation:** Extract key terms and concepts to automatically build a glossary or index.  
* **Content Simplification Recommendations:** Analyze complex sections and suggest ways to simplify language for better understandability.  
* **Enhanced Search Optimization:** Generate semantic tags to improve internal search relevance.  
* **Dynamic Table of Contents:** Automatically generate or adjust TOCs based on semantic segmentation of long pages.

## **3\. Scope**

### **In Scope:**

* **Major Quality Checks:**  
  * Analyze Markdown files for formatting issues (e.g., inconsistent header levels, broken links).  
  * Check for missing metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) and suggest corrections.  
* **AI‑Powered Semantic Analysis:**  
  * Process documentation to generate a quality score based on clarity, readability, and consistency.  
  * Provide backlink suggestions by identifying semantically related pages.  
  * Group similar pages and flag potential redundancies.  
  * Offer additional insights (e.g., keyword extraction, glossary suggestions, reorganization recommendations).  
* **User Interfaces:**  
  * Admin Dashboard: For maintainers to review quality scores, detailed reports, and semantic suggestions.  
  * Reader Indicators: Optional “quality badges” on pages that signal high content quality and improved interlinking.  
* **Integration:**  
  * Plugin integration with Docusaurus’s build process and configuration via docusaurus.config.js.  
  * RESTful API connections to any external AI microservices.

### **Out of Scope:**

* **Real‑Time Collaborative Editing:** The plugin focuses on analysis and suggestions rather than real‑time content collaboration.  
* **Automatic Content Correction:** The plugin provides suggestions and insights; final edits remain manual.  
* **Deep Customization of AI Models:** The focus is on leveraging pre‑trained models with optional fine‑tuning on sample documentation data.

## **4\. Target Users & User Stories**

### **4.1. Target Users:**

* **Documentation Maintainers (Admins):**  
   Technical writers, developers, and documentation managers who create and update documentation.  
* **Documentation Readers (Users):**  
   End‑users who rely on documentation for understanding and using software.

### **4.2. User Stories:**

#### **For Documentation Maintainers:**

* **US1:** *As a technical writer, I want the plugin to automatically scan my documentation for formatting errors, broken links, and missing metadata so that I can quickly fix issues before publishing.*  
* **US2:** *As a documentation manager, I want to see a dashboard of all suggestions after the system analyzes the semantic content of my docs and suggest backlinks and group similar pages, so I can have one place to improve navigation and reduce redundancy.*  
* **US3:** *As a documentation maintainer, I want to receive actionable insights on content clarity and readability, including recommendations for simplification and key term consistency.*

#### **For Documentation Readers:**

* **US4:** *As a user, I want to see quality badges or visual indicators on documentation pages that have been vetted for high quality and interlinking, so I can trust the information.*  
* **US5:** *As a reader, I want related content suggestions automatically displayed based on the page’s semantic content, making it easier to explore connected topics.*

## **5\. Roadmap & Milestones**

### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**

* Finalize detailed requirements.  
* Create UI/UX mockups for the admin dashboard and reader indicators.  
* Define API contracts for backend microservices (quality analysis, semantic grouping).

### **Phase 2: Backend Development**

* **Static Analysis Module:**  
  * Develop scripts (using Node.js or Python) to parse Markdown and check formatting, links, and metadata.  
* **Semantic Analysis Service:**  
  * Build a Python microservice (using FastAPI) that leverages Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BERT or GPT‑2) and Sentence Transformers to evaluate document quality and generate semantic embeddings.  
  * Implement logic to suggest backlinks and group similar pages.  
  * Explore additional semantic insights like keyword extraction and glossary generation.

### **Phase 3: Front-End Plugin Development**

* Develop a Docusaurus plugin using React to:  
  * Integrate quality analysis results into a dedicated admin dashboard.  
  * Display quality badges and cross‑link suggestions on documentation pages.  
* Ensure seamless integration with Docusaurus build lifecycle (using plugin lifecycle APIs).  
* Add a dashboard for documentation maintainers to see insights from the AI all in one place (make it available only to the devs, so during development phase only?)

### **Phase 4: Testing & Iteration**

* **Unit Testing:** Test static analysis functions and API endpoints.  
* **Integration Testing:** Validate end‑to‑end data flow between Docusaurus and backend microservices.  
* **User Acceptance Testing:** Gather feedback from documentation maintainers and readers.  
* **Performance Testing:** Ensure API responses and build times are within acceptable limits.

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation**

* Package the plugin and deploy the backend microservices.  
* Publish comprehensive documentation and usage guides.  
* Beta release and monitoring of performance and user feedback.

## **6\. Acceptance Criteria & Testing Requirements**

* **Static Content Analysis:**  
  * Must flag at least 90% of formatting errors, broken links, and metadata issues in a sample set.  
* **AI Semantic Analysis:**  
  * Should generate a quality score and actionable suggestions for each document within 60 seconds on average.  
  * Cross‑link suggestions must show an 80% precision on benchmark tests comparing known related topics.  
* **Admin Dashboard:**  
  * Must load quality metrics and suggestions for each page with a responsive UI.  
  * Provide clear, actionable feedback that maintainers can use to improve content.  
* **Reader Indicators:**
