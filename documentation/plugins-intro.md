Below is a step‑by‑step guide on how to build a Docusaurus plugin, along with references to key documentation pages:

## Step‑by‑Step Guide to Building a Docusaurus Plugin

### 1. Set Up a Docusaurus Project

- **Install Docusaurus CLI:**  
  Use the CLI to scaffold a new Docusaurus site.
  ```bash
  npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
  cd my-website
  ```
- **Familiarize Yourself with Docusaurus Core:**  
  Review the [docusaurus-core documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus-core) to understand how Docusaurus is structured.

### 2. Understand Plugin Architecture & Configuration

- **Docusaurus Config:**  
  Learn how plugins are added to your site via the `docusaurus.config.js` file by reviewing the [docusaurus-config API](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config).
- **Plugin Methods:**  
  Study the available methods in plugins, including:

  - [Plugin Lifecycle APIs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/lifecycle-apis) – methods invoked at different phases (initialize, load content, etc.).
  - [Extend Infrastructure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/extend-infrastructure) – methods to modify webpack config, theme settings, and other core behaviors.
  - [I18n Lifecycles](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/i18n-lifecycles) – for adding localization support.
  - [Static Methods](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/static-methods) – for generating static assets during build time.

  You can review the overall [Plugin Methods documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods) for an overview of what’s possible.

### 3. Create Your Plugin Structure

- **Folder Setup:**  
  Create a new folder (e.g., `packages/docusaurus-plugin-content-quality`) with a `package.json` file.
- **Entry Point:**  
  Create an `index.js` (or `index.ts` if using TypeScript) that exports a function following the Docusaurus plugin interface:
  ```js
  module.exports = function (context, options) {
    return {
      name: "docusaurus-plugin-content-quality",
      // Lifecycle hook: initialize plugin
      async loadContent() {
        // Your logic here
      },
      // Extend Webpack or modify site behavior
      configureWebpack(config, isServer, utils) {
        // Custom webpack config modifications
        return {}
      },
      // Other lifecycle hooks can be added as needed
    }
  }
  ```
- **Implement Plugin Methods:**  
  Use lifecycle APIs (like `loadContent`, `contentLoaded`, `postBuild`) to perform tasks such as analyzing content and generating reports. For example, in `contentLoaded`, you might process Markdown files to calculate quality scores and cross‑link suggestions.

### 4. Implement the Plugin Features

- **Static Analysis & AI Integration:**
  - Write functions that scan Markdown files for formatting, readability, and consistency.
  - Integrate external AI microservices (built with Python/other languages) via REST APIs to perform semantic analysis or generate suggestions.
- **Cross‑Linking Suggestions:**
  - Use NLP libraries (e.g., Sentence Transformers) in your analysis code to generate semantic embeddings and suggest related links.
- **Dashboard & UI Components:**
  - Optionally, include React components (using Docusaurus’s theming system) to render an admin dashboard for maintainers.
  - These components can be bundled with the plugin via the [extend-infrastructure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/extend-infrastructure) API.

### 5. Configure Your Plugin in docusaurus.config.js

- Add your plugin to the plugins array:
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ...other config options
    plugins: [
      [
        "docusaurus-plugin-content-quality",
        {
          // Pass options here, if any
          qualityThreshold: 80,
        },
      ],
    ],
  }
  ```

### 6. Testing & Debugging

- **Local Testing:**  
  Use the Docusaurus CLI (`npx docusaurus start`) to run your site locally and see how the plugin behaves.
- **Lifecycle Logs:**  
  Add logging within your lifecycle methods to debug issues.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Ensure your plugin correctly processes Markdown, communicates with AI services, and renders UI components as expected.

### 7. Packaging & Deployment

- **Bundle Your Plugin:**  
  Prepare your plugin for publication by ensuring it’s packaged correctly (using tools like Rollup or Webpack if needed).
- **Publish:**  
  Optionally publish on npm or keep it as a local plugin integrated with your Docusaurus site.

### 8. Documentation

- **User Guide:**  
  Create clear documentation for other developers on how to configure and use your plugin, following the style of official Docusaurus plugins.
- **API Reference:**  
  Document the exposed methods and options available in your plugin.

## Roadmap & Timeline

1. **Planning & Design (1–2 Weeks):**
   - Define plugin scope, features, and design UI mockups.
2. **Development (4–6 Weeks):**
   - Set up project structure and implement core plugin methods.
   - Develop static analysis and cross‑linking logic.
   - Integrate external AI microservices for semantic analysis.
3. **Testing & Debugging (2–3 Weeks):**
   - Local testing, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.
4. **Documentation & Packaging (1 Week):**
   - Write usage guides and package the plugin.
5. **Beta Release & Feedback (1–2 Weeks):**
   - Deploy plugin in a test environment, gather feedback, and iterate.

## Test to Pass Requirements

- **Functionality:**
  - The plugin must detect and flag formatting errors and broken links in at least 90% of test cases.
  - Quality scores and semantic suggestions must be generated within 60 seconds for standard documentation files.
- **Integration:**
  - The plugin should integrate seamlessly with Docusaurus’s build process (using lifecycle hooks) without significantly increasing build time (ideally <10% increase).
- **UI & UX:**
  - The admin dashboard must display quality metrics and cross‑link suggestions clearly, with positive feedback from beta testers.
- **API Performance:**
  - REST API calls to external AI microservices should return responses within 2 seconds under normal load.

By following these steps and guidelines, you can build a robust Docusaurus plugin that enhances content quality by performing automated static analysis, generating semantic cross‑link suggestions, and providing actionable insights for documentation maintainers. This solution will add significant value to both maintainers and readers by ensuring documentation is consistent, interconnected, and easy to navigate.

Happy building, and best of luck with your plugin!
